# Unlimited Callouts 2

A fixed/updated version of the [Unlimited Callouts mod by Sambot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563159491), updated to work with newer versions of Prison Architect.

## What is this?

Unlimited Callouts is a mod for Prison Architect that does two things:

1. Allows you to have practically infinite emergency services callouts (i.e. firemen, paramedics, riot police; technically the limit is `2^31 - 1`, but for all intents and purposes, that is as good as infinite)

2. Adds soldiers / National Guard to the list of emergency services callouts, costing $1000 per truck of six troops, and also having the same practically infinite limit as the other callouts.

It has become slightly dysfunctional in more recent versions of the game (the callout for the soldiers will appear, but none of the buttons are actually clickable), so this particular mod aims to do the same thing for recent versions of Prison Architect.

## Installation

Install the mod off of [Steam Workshop](#). *(Link TBA)*
