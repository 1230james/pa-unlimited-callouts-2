Description          "Raises the callout limit for all callouts to (practically) infinite, and adds a ground-based elite ops team callout.\n\nThe ground-based elite ops team can be called in for $1000. They arrive in troop trucks in squads of 6. You do NOT need the Island Bound DLC in order to use the ground-based elite ops callouts. Troop trucks have also received a slight speed buff to match the speed of other emergency vehicles.\n\nDon't have the DLC for helicopters and want to remove the helicopter callouts? Try out my No Air Callouts mod in combination with this mod! If you do, remember to place the No Air Callouts mod higher on the priority list.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/1230james/pa-unlimited-callouts-2\nNo Air Callouts mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564811608\nSambot's original Unlimited Callouts mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563159491"
