Description          "Raises the callout limit for all callouts to (practically) infinite, and adds both ground-based and air-based National Guard (soldiers) callout.\n\nThe ground-based soldiers can be called in for $1000. They arrive in troop trucks in squads of 6. The air-based soldiers can be called in for $12000, arriving in squads in 14.\n\nThis mod also features some miscellaneous changes:\n• Troop trucks have also received a slight speed buff to match the speed of other emergency vehicles.\n• Soldiers not shouting when issued a move order has been fixed.\n• Elite Ops now make identical sounds to soldiers (walking sound effects and shouting when move orders are issused).\n• Visitor helicopters now have helicopter sound effects.\n\nDon't have the DLC for helicopters and want to remove the helicopter callouts? Try out my No Air Callouts mod in combination with this mod! If you do, remember to place the No Air Callouts mod higher on the priority list. No Air Callouts will also remove the air-based soldiers callout from this mod.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/1230james/pa-unlimited-callouts-2\nNo Air Callouts mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564811608\nSambot's original Unlimited Callouts mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563159491"
